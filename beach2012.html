<center><h2>Beach Cleaning Drive</h2></center><hr>
SoRT in collaboration with seven Rotaract clubs spread across Mumbai arranged the clean-up drive on 30th September 2012, Sunday, at Juhu beach. This event was held on a day next to Ganapati Visarjan with a motto to maximize the cleaning of beach. The event was open for all the college students.
Around 90 socially active students along with the SRIs ( SoRT Incharge) participated to make the event a grand one and elevate it to a greater level.. The event started at around 8:30 am at Juhu Beach, Vile Parle. All the volunteers were given a pair of disposable gloves and a trash bag to collect the waste they found. Being a day after Ganapati Visarjan, maximum dumped waste were found littered on the beach, including Plaster Of Paris (one of the most dangerous substance which takes a toll on the aquatic life), plastic materials and flowers. All the participants showed a lot of enthusiasm in cleaning the beach. With around 2.5-3 hrs of hard-work the VESITians managed to clean-up quite a large section of the beach.
A large amount of waste was gathered and then disposed off safely with due precautions. After the cleaning session was over, the participants were provided with refreshments. The event winded up at around 11:30 am on a great note. SoRTâ€™s intention to sow a seed of awareness and love towards the nature thus proved fruitful. The Beach Clean-Up drive was indeed a Grand Event from the inception of its idea, its wonderful execution and a successful end.
