<center><h2>Shiksha At Yeour</h2></center><hr>
Keeping  in  mind  the  theme  of  the  events  for  the  even   semester  that  is  Project-SHIKSHA , the  Social  Responsibility  Team (SoRT)  of   Vivekanand  Education  Society  Institute  of  Technology  came  up  with  an  event  of  conducting  teaching  sessions  for  the  students  of  8th,9th and  10th  standard. These teaching sessions were held in Graminvikas Mandal Pandit Prathamik School at Yeour. SoRT had 10 teaching sessions for the children beginning in the month of January 2014 and continuing till the end of February 2014. Teaching at Yeour was the first event of the even semester. The  event  started  on  a  promising  note  on  11th  January, 2014. Initially, the  SRIs  interacted  with  a  few  students  and  discussed  their  problems  and  what  all  difficulties  they  faced. Building  a  rapport  and  some  bond  with  the  students  was  the  priority  so  as  to  ensure  that  the  students  could  study  in  a  friendly  atmosphere. The  SRIs  conducted  a  fun  teaching  session  on  the  first   day  which  basically  included  interacting  with  the  students. Before the actual inception of the event, we had talks with the Principal of the school Mrs Nutan Joshi who gave us a grass root idea of the situation of the students there and their level. We also interacted with Mr Pankaj Gurav, the CEO of a NGO called School Without Walls, who gave us ideas on how to go about the event. The NGO has been active in the school for past few years. The  main  motive  of  this  event  was  to  create  awareness  about  the  importance  of  education  amongst  the  students. The  main  subjects  taught  were  Mathematics  and  English as  the  students  faced  some  difficulties  in  these  subjects. The SRIs  taught  right  from  the  basics  which  gave  the  students  a  clear  overview  of  the  subject. SRIs  also  cleared  their  doubts  before  their  exams  and  also  taught  them  paper  presentation techniques  and  easier  methods  of  studying  and  quick  revision  techniques. Overall  the  sessions  were  a  good  blend  of  fun  and  studies. This  not  only  helped  the  students  prepare  for  their  examinations  but  also  taught  them  the  importance  of  education  to  equip  them  to  be  decent  and  productive  citizens. The sessions often involved encouraging the students to opt for college education and reduce the dropout rate in the village.
