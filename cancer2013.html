<center><h2>Visit to Cancer Kids</h2></center><hr>
The Social Responsibility Team( SoRT) of Vivekanand Education Society's Institute of Technology (VESIT) visited the ‘St. Jude India Child Care Centre’ at TATA Memorial Hospital, Kharghar on 1st  October, 2013. After a successful   IIT-B I-SMOKE  campaign  on 16th - 17th September, SoRT had very less time at their disposal to prepare for this visit. However, SoRT managed to successfully implement this event.
After a brief amount of research on the internet to search for a care centre to visit the SJICCC was finalized. A few members of the team also visited the centre a few days prior to the event to plan and organize the event. The first hiccup we faced was the change of dates because of a staff meeting scheduled on the same day as we had planned our event. Planning for the event was a big job for us. We had to be extra precocious with everything since the kids were suffering from cancer. Right from the food we were going to serve to the games we planned to play everything was approved from the staff at the care centre prior to the visit. 
A drama was performed on ‘Akbar and Birbal’ which was headed by Amit Bhatija and the children enjoyed it very much. Seeing the kids laugh and enjoy made the atmosphere extremely jolly and happy. Then we played games with children in which they participated  very eagerly. 
The SoRT team along with everyone who accompanied them returned with a wider perspective of life harmony and fulfillment. We hope to continue with the same kind of unity and dedication for all our future endeavors.
