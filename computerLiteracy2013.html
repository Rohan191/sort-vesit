<center><h2>Computer Literacy Program</h2></center><hr>
With a multitude of back-to-back events taking place every year, SoRT VESIT has been one of the pioneers in bringing about developments in the society. This year, it has been no different. The even semester for SoRT VESIT started on a high note with Project Shiksha as the theme. A myriad of activities were conducted, the Computer Literacy Program being one of the major highlights.	Citizens Association for Child Rights-CACR, is a network of likeminded citizens concerned about ensuring child rights with specific focus on ensuring good quality of education and health for all children. The network comprises of citizens who will visit neighborhood municipal schools and clinics, and participate in various programs like School Management Committees, Computer Literacy Program and Virtual Classroom projects, etc. and oversee the overall functioning and quality of education in municipal schools. SoRT-VESIT, in association with CACR, conducted the Computer Literacy Program, founded by IIT Bombay. About 12 students participated in the teaching program that spanned for over one month. Mr. Deepak Wadhwani and Dr. Richa Singh, the core members of CACR orchestrated the program with representatives of the Social Responsibility Team of VESIT. The event commenced with a Libre Office training which was conducted for all the volunteers by representatives from IIT Bombay. The teaching sessions began in the month of March and continued till mid-April. The program was targeted mainly at teaching 5th, 6th and 7th standard students the basics of open software applications like Libre Office writer etc. Basic computer hardware introductions were also given as an additional training. About roughly three sessions every week were conducted for students of 5th, 6th and 7th grade. Hearty response from the students and staff has motivated CACR as well as SoRT VESIT to carry our more such operations in the near future. After all, just as they rightly say, education is the greatest gift one can impart to others.
