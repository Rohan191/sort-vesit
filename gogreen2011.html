<center><h2>Go Green Campaign</h2></center><hr>
Our unprecedented growth of technology and dependence on the same has put such a burden on our environment, that without a consecrated effort it'll soon crumble. This event had been organized as our bid to salvage our environment and our Earth. The event started off at 9:00 a.m. with inauguration by Mr. Amar T. Asrani, Secretary of VES R.G Rajan, CMD of Rashtriya Chemical Factory and Sri Sri Balananda Brahmachari of Ramakrishna Mission. The event was sponsored by Rashtriya Chemical factory, Maharashtra Times, Fever 105 FM and global advertisers. The event saw enthusiastic participation from students from all V.E.S. institutions. The SoRT team of our college was also present, including the first year SoRT members as well as other volunteer students. All participants of the campaign were given T-shirts and caps. Placards and posters with messages and illustrations that would encourage environmental conservation were distributed amongst the participants. The rally started with enthusiastic cries of “Clean India, Green India” the motto of the campaign by all the participants. It started from the VES Hashu Advani campus and took a detour via Diamond Garden to the RCF premises. The people at RCF welcomed and appreciated the campaign.
