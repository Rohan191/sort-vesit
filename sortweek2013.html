<center><h2>SoRT Week 13-14</h2></center><hr>
One of the most awaited events conducted in college this year, SoRT week was held from 26th of August to 2nd September. It was organized by the truly spirited SRI's of SE, TE and BE. A plethora of activities were conducted during the week, new ideas were put forth and new initiatives were undertaken, which helped open doors for a wide spectra of possibilities and opportunities. A brief overview of the same has been given below: Starting from this year, SoRT decided to have a theme for the week namely- "Restoring Hope-The Power of Social Work " . It rightly highlighted the very essence of SoRT and showcased the magnitude of impact that social work in any field could bring about. SoRT collaborated with 4 NGOs this year, namely- NASEOH, Self-Esteem, SPJ Sadhana School and Jai Vakeel. The main motive was to help in selling products made by physically and mentally challenged and thereby helping the organizations that represented them to raise funds. Enthusiastic response from the college students and staff further emboldened the SoRT Team in carrying out this objective. Desks were set up on three floors-ground, second and fifth floor and articles from various NGOs were kept on display. SRIs had been assigned on each floor to attend to the respective desks. Donations boxes were kept on each floor and students and teachers donated generously throughout the week. SoRT believes that it has a long way to go in order to do complete justice to its motto-"Be the wings the world needs". Hence, the team believes that every contribution has the power to bring about a huge difference. With new faces becoming a part of the SoRT family, the team hopes to attain success in its endeavours with its spirit of unity, faith and dedication.
