<center><h2>Shiksha At Chinchpada</h2></center><hr>
Chinchpada has been adopted by SoRT for past two years and we have been conducting various events timely to benefit the villagers. Chinchpada is a village with mud houses, hand-pump and schools with no benches available for students. Event in Chinchpada was conducted on 16th March, 2014. As the theme for the semester was decided as SHIKSHA and looking for development of children in that village SoRT decided to conduct this event. Event started with an interaction with a teacher at the school. Interactive session began with asking their names and then we asked about education facilities provided to them. Some boys and girls were really very shy to talk but some were very frank and interacted with us very efficiently. People around us were amused to see us interacting and playing with their village children. We gathered all children in the compound of primary school. We were glad to see that 63 students will become the part of our event. We made them sit in their primary school. The event commenced with distribution of books, drawing books, crayons, pencil, scale, eraser to each and every child sitting in classroom. Children were very happy to get gifts. We provided them platform to show case their talent. We had announced that children coming and showing their talent will be rewarded. Motto behind this sub-event was to achieve victory over their stage fear. Many of the children came forward to show their talent. Some of them sang poems in Marathi and some sang Bollywood songs. Then we provided with craft papers so that children could show their artistic talent. Children made different craft articles like lantern, various types of boats, birds, dog face, decorative strips and many more. All of them were very enthusiastic throughout this session. They made articles and came to show us. In the mean-time we all had mingled with children very efficiently. We were amused to see various innovative craft articles made by children. Finally, the event completed with distribution of chips packet, frooti and chocolates to everyone. The event ended on a very positive note as we received an overwhelming response from children who showed their willingness and excitement to support this event. The SoRT team along with everyone who accompanied them returned with a wider perspective of life harmony and fulfilment. We hope to continue with the same kind of unity and dedication for all our future endeavors.
