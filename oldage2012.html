<center><h2>Visit to Old Age Home</h2></center><hr>
SoRT ended its activities for this semester with a visit to "Swami Shanti Prakash Vrudhashram" on 2nd October, 2012. After a successful Beach Clean Up on 30th October, SoRT had very less time at their disposal to prepare for this visit. However, SoRT managed to successfully implement this event. The event was conducted in the premises of old age home itself. Getting people for the event from their rooms, proved to be a task in itself. However, with help from staff we managed to coax them in being the part of our event. Meanwhile others were busy looking after all the arrangements.
The event began with a musical performance by Gaurav Ahuja which was applauded by everyone. Later on members of our musical society "Bliss" gave some scintillating performances on devotional songs which touched every one's heart. Some enthusiasts from the audience came ahead and gave their solo performances. Finally the performances ended with a mesmerizing dance performance by SoRT members. It included various retro songs which greatly entertained the audience.
When all the performances were done, at the end there was a cake cutting ceremony. Everyone in the room seemed like children, jovial and excited in sharing cake with each others. Members of SoRT also went to each and every room in the old age home to ensure that everyone got the snacks With a united effort from SoRT and Bliss, the event was successful as it ended with a smile on many faces and content in many hearts.
