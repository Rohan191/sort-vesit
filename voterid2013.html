<center><h2>For a Better India..!!</h2></center><hr>
The  Social  Responsibility Team (SoRT)  of  Vivekanand  Education  Society’s  Institute  of  Technology conducted  an  event  which  helped  the  students  to  apply  for  their  Voter  IDs in the college premises. The event  was conducted  on  9th ,10th and 14th of October, 2013 between 12pm to 4 pm  which gained tremendous response from the students.
VESIT stood out amongst all the colleges in Mumbai where the campaign was conducted registering a humongous 400+ number of registrations. The  event  concluded  with  a  feeling  of  satisfaction  and  content  experienced  by  everyone associated  with  the  event. The  organizers  were  extremely  pleased  with  the  amazing  response  received  from  VESIT  students. The  entire  SoRT   team  thanked  them  for  this  event  and  promised  to  extend  their  support  for  future  events  which  can  be  beneficial  for  the  society. This  event  benefitted  all  the  students  as  the  process  of  making  voter  IDs  was  made  much  easier  and  it  also  appealed  to  a  large  number  of  students.
The  Voter  ID  event  was  indeed  a  great  event  from  the  inception  of  its  idea, its wonderful execution and a successful end. The event ended on a very positive note as we received  an  overwhelming  response  from students who  showed  their willingness to support this  event  which  can  lead  to  a  better  India.
