<center><h2>Visit to Alandi</h2></center><hr>
SoRT VESIT as a part of its Project 'SHIKSHA' for the even semester visited Alandi on 19th February, 2014. SoRT VESIT donated twenty-five (25) 'Braille Kits' at a blind girl’s school in Alandi. The school named Jaguti Andh Vidyalaya at Alandi was one such school in need of these kits for the education the blind girls there. The start of this venture was made by contacting Mr. Gurav and Mr. Hegde (who themselves are visually impaired), the Secretary and President of 'National Federation For The Blind', who were generous enough to allow us do this event at one of their centers. The kits were brought from 'National Association For the Blind' at Worli Sea face.
The 25 kits to be donated at the school were brought prior to the event. After SoRT reached at the school all the girls were called downstairs. 'Jagruti Andh Vidyalaya' is a residential school for One-hundred and Five (105) girls. They aligned themselves adeptly without anyone's help. Their efficiency made all of us awestruck. The event started on a positive note as Mr. Aptre came up and thanked the entire team for this deed of donating the braille kits. He, himself being blind, showed us the use of every single instrument prevailing in the braille kit. It constituted of a writing pad, pen, paper fixer, geometry box, thick papers. He showed us the technique of reading the braille books which of course needs a good time span to master. Their promptness in reading them made us marvel at their sharp skills. They showed us some other braille books too.
We also visited the school’s new campus which is currently under development. The motto of our project ‘Shiksha’ was to spread knowledge and make education possible for all. It’s not just people like us who deserve access to education, but even the blind have an equal right to it. As it is said by a great person, “There is nothing greater than the spreading of knowledge. It is the greatest asset taken or given to any individual.”
