<center><h2>Annadan In Badlapur</h2></center><hr>
Food Drives are part of Social Responsibility Programs. Food donation helps feeding an increasing number of people in need throughout County. SoRT VESIT, thus came up with an idea to conduct Grain Donation Drive, Aannadaan at Beru Matimand Pratishthan, Badlapur. We conducted fund raising drive at college for 4 days. These funds were utilized to purchase the food items and steel containers prior to the event. The event was conducted on 27th February, 2014, in the morning at 11 am. Before the event began, the people showed us the entire orphanage and the different needs of the mentally challenged people. The main concept of the event was to generate awareness of the people and encourage them to donate a small amount of money towards annadan. The donation drive received and overwhelming response in the college. To encourage donations, the video of the Mental Orphanage, given by them, was displayed in college. Everyone from students to teachers donated their hearts out for the event.
