<center><h2>GIV-A-COIN</h2></center><hr>
The Give A Coin campaign was conducted by SoRT in VESIT Campus on 6th and 7th September. This event was conducted to support the financial child adoption. It was an IIT Bombay initiation in association with 'Pratham Council for Vulnerable Children (PCVC)' which works for under privileged children. SoRT supported this cause by conducting a two-day campaign emphasizing on financial child adoption and how today's youth can show support towards the same by merely giving ' a coin ' . The motto of this event was to create awareness among youth about financial child adoption and instill among them the feeling that they could be potential donors in near future. Every year IITB presents the Techfest, its international science and technology festival. And over years Techfest has created ripples nationwide by constantly striving for a social cause being patronized by UNESCO. This year their noble act of ‘Financial child Adoption’ through the ‘Give a coin campaign’ was supported by nearly 40 colleges in Mumbai including VESIT. As a part of this campaign, 4 volunteers came from the PRATHAM foundation to our college to conduct this event along with SoRT. A desk was set-up on the ground floor at the entrance from 11 am to 3 pm. To create awareness about this social cause, handouts were distributed in all classes. The event was inaugurated by our Principal, Mrs. J.M.Nair.
