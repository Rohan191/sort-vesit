<center><h2>Group Discussions for SE's</h2></center><hr>
The Social Responsibility Team (SoRT) of Vivekanand Education Society's Institute of Technology came up with an event of conducting group discussion exclusively for second year students. SoRT VESIT held a series of group discussions during SoRT WEEK involving various students of both shifts of Second year i.e. morning and afternoon shift. The sole intention of this event was to create awareness among students about the various social issues concerning our society and let them express their views and suggest solutions to existing scenario. Thus the students got a chance to get an exposure of formal GD's which further helped them to strengthen their communication skills. With this initiative of SoRT, all the students got to experience a sense of belongingness towards the happenings in college regarding the social matters addressed by SoRT. The event ended on a very positive note as we received an overwhelming response from students who shown their willingness to participate in the group discussion. The students got a chance to get experience for their very first group discussion. The group discussion was indeed a Grand Event from the inception of its idea, it's wonderful execution and a successful end.
