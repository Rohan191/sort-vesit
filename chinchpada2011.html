<center><h2>Chinchpada Visit</h2></center><hr>
While the optimists like to talk about the various projects and numerous campaigns undertaken by the government and the NGOs for the welfare of women and children and development of villages; visits to villages like Chinchpada (located in Shahapur district of Thane) will definitely prove that all our efforts are just concentrated on the tip of a massive iceberg made up of poverty coupled with dearth of basic health-care facility. Thus, the Social Responsibility Team (SoRT) of V.E.S.I.T. along-with Dr. Manish Motwani of Aastha Health Care, Mulund and Mr. Deepak Lilani of Rotary Club of Mulund Hillview organized a “Free Health Check-up Campaign” for the children in the Chinchpada village of Shahapur district, Thane on March 18, 2012. The village is very remote (the closest station Atgaon being 10-15 kilometers away) and faces acute shortage of basic facilities such as electricity, water, health-care, education, etc. It was an enlightening experience, especially for the SoRT volunteers as they witnessed the hardships faced by the villagers and how as budding engineers they can contribute to development of such villages. The SoRT hopes that the children of the village were benefitted by this campaign and with introduction of computer education in their curriculum, will trigger ambitions of higher education. We hope to undertake more such events in the future which will help many more villages.
