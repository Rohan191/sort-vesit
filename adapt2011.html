<center><h2>Visit to Adapt</h2></center><hr>
On the 22nd of September, the Social Representative Team of VESIT organized a visit to a school in Bandra. ADAPT is basically a school for disabled children, formerly known as The Spastic Society Of India. ADAPT is a school from 1st grade to 10th grade, where students of various ages and different disabilities come to learn. The students are extremely loving and affectionate. After the music event, we had a hand painting session. A 12 by 10 feet cloth was arranged with the Adapt logo on it. Each child was made to dip his/her hand in their favorite paint color and their imprints were taken on the cloth. They were very thrilled about that too. By the end of it, each child had a colored hand! The cloth was given to the school as a remembrance. A 6 kg cake was ordered by the SoRT team. This cake was cut and distributed to the entire school. We also went to each class and interacted with the children during their break time. On a concluding note, the acclaimed movie, “I am Kalam” was telecasted by our team for the children. This movie was shown in the auditorium and every student was completely engrossed in the movie. At the end of the event, we spent some final moments with the staff and children of the school. Overall, this experience was something which we won’t ever forget! Seeing so many smiles spread across tiny little faces was a dream come true! By the end of the day, some of the children had already got attached to some of the members of SoRT, letting go was very hard! This is what our team aims at! After the response we received from ADAPT, we have set up a high benchmark, with hopes that the next event on roll shall leave no stone unturned in reaching out to the Society at large in every way possible!
