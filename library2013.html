<center><h2>Library Setup</h2></center><hr>
The Social Responsibility Team (SoRT) of Vivekanand Education Society's Institute of Technology made a grand beginning by initializing the theme of the year Project-SHIKSHA  by setting up a library for the NGOs named KATALYST and CORO. KATALYST is a program under the aegis of Third Sector Partners and Hunt Partners which aims to create conditions so that girls not only participate in the educational empowerment process, but also achieve self enhancement through economic emancipation. Prior to the library setup a books collection drive was held in our college wherein students from our college donated all sorts of educational books, novels, and comics as well as all semesters engineering books. This drive was held from 7th till 14th of February, 2014 which was a great success as we got a good response from all the students. By the end of the drive we got a collection of 200+ books which was indeed a big help for the NGO's. Prior to the event book collection posters were put up in college which encouraged students to donate the books. We also coordinated with another NGO named CORO (Committee of Resource Organizations) for literacy is a community owned organization working on holistic community development in the Chembur- Trombay regions of Mumbai. Our library set up event concluded with a complete feeling of satisfaction of what we on our part could do to help small children, girls whose economic condition were poor.
