<center><h2>SoRT Premier League</h2></center><hr>
On 14th of February 2012, the Social representative team of VESIT organized a Sports event for the children of "Akanksha Foundation". The basic idea of this event was to add a social touch to the official sports event of our college, Sphurti. All the matches were played at our own college ground. All the children of the "˜Akanksha Foundation" were brought from the foundation to our college by the members of the Social Representative Team of our college. Before the sports event begun, we had organized a lecture hosted by Mr. Nagananda Sir regarding further studies in India and abroad. The lecture lasted about 40 minutes. The cricket matches were totally 10 overs(5 overs being bowled per team) out of which 2 overs had to be bowled by the children of the foundation. In a similar way, the batting had to be opened by the children of the foundation. There were two rounds of consisting of 2 matches each and then the finals. The Dodge-ball game which was held for the girls of the foundation were 20 minutes each. Each match was approximately 20 minutes. Out of a team of 10 girls, 5 had to be from the foundation and the remaining 5 were the students of our college. There were 2 players in the target team, out of which, one had to be from the foundation. At the end of the day, the event was a success and a huge learning experience for all our students. Interacting with these children changes the way of our thinking to a great extent.
