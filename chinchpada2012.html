<center><h2>Chinchpada Visits</h2></center><hr>
On Sunday,5th August 2012, the Social Responsibility Team of VESIT, accompanied by Sachin Sir as Staff Incharge, the General Secretary of the council and many volunteers headed out for the second event of the year 2012. They visited the village of Chinchpada in Shahpur district, about 5 km from Atgaon station. The sole intention of this visit was to spend the day with the children creating awareness about hygiene and healthcare. The SoRT team of VESIT conducted the dayâ€™s event in collaboration with AASTHA Healthcare, Mulund and Rotary club of Mulund Hillview. Once the Doctors and Rotary Club members arrived the children were lead into a room, where they were vaccinated. 105 children were vaccinated with anti worms and given vitamins. The SORT team worked with incredible energy and efficiency in helping the doctors and handled the children very well. The doctors even solved queries of various parents. Before leaving the doctors congratulated the SORT team for their efforts and successful event. On17th February 2013, the Social Responsibility Team of VESIT organized its mega event of the year. The village named Chinchpada near Atgaon located in the outskirts of Mumbai faces water problem every year during the months of April and May. SoRT decided to curb this problem for the villagers by installing a borewell in the village as it seemed the only viable option. This event bears great significance for every SoRTer not only because of the mega scale on which it was conducted but also because of the similar mega event of installation of a Bio-Gas plant back in 2010 which led to SoRT's induction into the student council. A health-check up drive for all the adults in the village was another part of the mega event of SoRT.
