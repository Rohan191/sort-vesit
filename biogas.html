<center><h2>BioGas Installation</h2></center><hr>
After the commendable success of their first event of 2010 at Bal Anand, Social Responsibility Team (SoRT) came up with another innovative idea, an idea to inculcate a social aspect into the lives of Engineering students. The SoRT team along with guidance of an expert, set up a Biogas Plant at Light House Orphanage, Badlapur. The most important aspect of this work was the set-up of a cost effective biogas plant. The feasibility of this biogas plant lies in its simple construction. The plant was made using two plastic water tanks, few pipes and common compost (i.e. cowdung, kitchen waste, etc.) Since all these were easily available, it led to the production of biogas which could act as a cheper yet efficient substitute for fuel for the orphanage. The members of SoRT team helped in the setup of this plant and took care of the whole activity-- right from contacting the expert, purchasing the tanks, till the on site set-up of the actual plant. Moreover the SoRT team spent some time with the children of orphanage. The children showcased some amazing talent—be it Music or dance, the children were commendable at a colorful display of their own merit. Moreover, the authorities were happy to have a bio gas plant installed, as it’ll greatly reduce their dependence on LPG to cook food for the children. This event has showcased how engineering can be practically applied, so that it can help the society as also add a splash of color to so many young lives.
