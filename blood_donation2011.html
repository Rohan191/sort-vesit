<center><h2>Blood Donation Camps</h2></center><hr>
 The first event that was organised for the year 2012-2013 was the 'Blood Donation Camp'. It was held in association with Hashu Advani Memorial Trust. The Blood Donation Camp not only benefited the cause but also appealed to a large section of students who would otherwise not have the necessary means to be a part of such camps. A Thalassemia check-up was also done for the donors. A similar camp was organised later in the even semester which also received tremendous response from the students.
The events concluded with feelings of satisfaction and content experienced by everyone associated with the event. The doctors and organisers were very pleased with the response they received from VESIT students and are eager to conduct many more camps. The volunteers from SoRT team thanked them for choosing VESIT to arrange the blood donation camp and promised to extend the support in order to conduct such beneficial activities in the future.
