<center><h2>VISIT TO BALANAND</h2></center><hr>
The reasons may vary in each case but what remains common is how a smile was wiped out just when it was blossoming. But few people and institutions come together to help these children and one such institution us an orphanage called Bal Anand in Chembur. This institute plays a significant role, nurturing children right from infancy till they complete secondary education, after which they are sent to the other wing in Badlapur. However, only good will cannot sustain a good cause. These institutions need as much help as they can get from other people to continue with their good work. The Social Responsibility Team (Sort), which is an active social group formed by students of V.ES.I.T. (Chembur), in its goal for helping the society, was deeply moved by the work done by Bal Anand and decided to help them to further their cause. As education is the basic tool for improving the future of any child, SoRT ,with the help of authorities of Bal Anand setup a library for children. The library consisted of books for children of all ages residing in the institution. The SoRT team also a spent a whole day with the children in Bal Anand, playing and interacting with them. The children were especially pleased to have the young engineers in SoRT around them. However, the SoRT team learned a lot from these children. The whole day spent with them, the smiles gathered and the satisfaction achieved was an incredible experience to each member of SoRT. It was truly an enlightenment to these young engineers trying to reach out to the society and its needs in every possible way.
